# The Dyson Sphere Project

This mod adds some aspects of a Dyson Sphere (https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dyson_sphere) into Minecraft.

The goal is to provide an endgame automation goal, something that can be further expanded by changing the recipes into an "expert progression".
The mod is not very useful on its own, it is designed to be used in a modpack.
