If you have multiple hooks deployed you will end up somewhere between them. In Stopped Mode you will fall into balance based on gravity. When already below the grappling hook you will truly stop. Unwinding mode behaves just like stopped mode, with the difference that you will slowly sink lower, up to the length of your rope. Don't wiggle to much at the very end of the rope."
